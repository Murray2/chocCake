		<h1> Murray's <br> Molten Chocolate Cake Tarts</h1>
	</div>

	<hr>
	<p>This is a recipe I have modified slightly from the <strong><a
				href="https://www.commanderspalace.com/about/our-story" target="_blank">Commander's Palace</a></strong>
		in New Orleans. Five awesome ingredients in one dish, so simple and
		delicious. This recipe comes from the same restaurant that brings us our school's jalapeno cornbread. It is just
		the right amount for about 4 large chocolate cake portions (or 6 smaller ones). If you want to scale this recipe
		up, these cakes freeze and microwave nicely. As long as you don't reheat them too long, the middle will be a
		runny chocolate sauce.</p>

	<h2> Recipe: </h2>

	<ul><strong>
			<li>6 tbsp of butter, softened</li>
			<li>1/2 lbs semi sweet chocolate</li>
			<li>4 eggs</li>
			<li>3/4 cups of sugar</li>
			<li>3/4 cups of flour</li>
		</strong></ul>

	<h2> Procedure: </h2>

	<p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit</p>
	<p> Use 2 tablespoons of the butter to grease 4 ramekins or oven proof coffee cups, silicon, or muffin tins. Check
		to see that all surfaces are completely covered with butter especially the corners.</p>

	<div class="center">

	</div>

	<p> Place the remaining 10 tablespoons of butter with the chocolate (in small pieces) in the top part of a double
		broiler or in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of barley simmering water. Stir until it is a smooth butter
		ganache, DO NOT OVER COOK for your chocolate will become grainy.</p>

	</div>

	<p> Break the eggs into the work-bowl of the food processor (or bowl with a wisk). Add the sugar and beat until air
		is incorporated. Using theÂ <strong><a href="https://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Cake-making/Creaming-method"
			target="_blank">creaming method</a></strong>, proceed until the mixture is smooth and fluffy.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Pour in chocolate and butter ganache mixture: mix for 10 seconds.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Sift the flour in and process for another 10 seconds. Scrape down the inside of the work-bowl with a spatula, and
		process until smooth, about another 10 seconds more.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/addFlour.jpg" alt="Add Flour" style="width:80%; height: 100%;" class="rotateimg90">
	</div>

	<p>
		Pour an equal amount of the batter into each ramekin so they cook at the same speed. Place the chocolate cakes
		in the oven and bake in a preheated oven.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/bake.jpg" alt="In the Oven" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>Pulling these out of the oven at the right time is the key. The mixture begins to rise in the center and is still
		runny, if it rises too much they are over cooked (but they still taste like delicious chocolate cakes). Remove the
		souffles from the oven, and let them cool in the fridge. If they are over cooked you can just eat them right
		away.</p>

	<div class="center">

	<p>Once they have cooled down you can remove them from the baking container and plastic wrap them.</p>
	<br>

	<p>
		Once cooled down the middle is hard so you can put them in the refrigerator and microwave them for 25 seconds
		when you want one. Or you can freeze them if you have a lot and want to save some for another time. You can
		microwave them from frozen.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>*If you want extra molten sauce in the middle, you can freeze small balls of the batter and place it in the
			middle of the cake batter before you bake them. <strong>ENJOY!</strong></em>
